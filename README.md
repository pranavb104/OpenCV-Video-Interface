# OpenCV-Video-Interface
A small interface created to control videos on a parallel thread with key commands.

This project was compiled using Cmake. I'm not providing the cmake files as it combines other libraries not useful for this particular project.

The main libraries associated with this is boost and OpenCV. You can manually add these libraries to your developing environment.

You can use your own video and sound files for this project to play each on individial threads, also providing options for dubbing videos with other audio files.
